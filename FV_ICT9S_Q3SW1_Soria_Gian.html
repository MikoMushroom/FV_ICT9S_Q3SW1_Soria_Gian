Her mind is filled with creativity and was able to make a few inventions while at this school. She was the type to bully and tease people around and was very playful with people. She was sort of the the typical comic releife. Even tho she is quite a mean person, she was a very big part of the story as she dominated the investigations using her gadgets and logic.

					<p class="card-text"> <h6 class="text-light">The Ultimate Magician... </h6> Or you may call her by her prefered title, The Ultimate Mage. Himiko is a very sleepy/tired character as she takes so long to respond back in conversations and is always not paying attention. Everyone always suspected her because people had ideas of the "too innocent" person being the actual killer. After many deaths and executions she stayed strong after many of her friends died. Suprisingly, even tho she is considered to be the weakest person in the school out of 16 students she managed to survive with two other people. </p>

She sadly got murdered as she was sacrificed along with with Angie Yonaga who got murdered at night because she was walking to her room. Himiko was devistated and swore revenge. In the next chapter after she was murdered, Himiko was able to avenge Tenko  </p>

					<p class="card-text"> <h6 class="text-light">The Ultimate Cosplayer... </h6> Tsumugi isnt really the most noticeable character. She mostly just stands by and speaks when she feels like she need too. She also dosnt have any realations with other characters as she didnt really make friends. All of this has made people think she was just a normal person. In fact, she was the reason why everyone was there, she planned the whole murder mystery and was the actual first person to murder someone and friend another person which caused someone to be eliminated but not her. In the end, she died being crushed by a boulder at a cutscene when the whole school started collapsing.  </p>

					<p class="card-text"><h6 class="text-light"> The Ultimate Pianist...</h6> Kaede is the protagonist of this series. She is just a normal protagonist trying to inspire everyone and encourage everyone. Her character is very interesting because she was a different protagonist. She had a motive to kill the person behind all of this to let everyone free. She killed someone trying to save everyone thinking it was the person behind all of this. She thought she was succesful but in reality she wasnt. She killed Rantaro and was blamed for it, but in reality Tsumugi killed him. She was sadly executed shortly after even tho she wasnt the one who killed him. The info was only revealed in the end of the series.   </p>

She always isolated herself from others and didnt really attend meetings at dinner. Maki was a cold/serious character that only speaks when spoken to. In the middle of the series, it was reveal that she wasnt a baby sitter, ironically she was The Ultimate Assasin. People didnt really believe her at that point and always kept accusing her. She had never killed anyone in the series and was one of the three survivors. She was sort of a detective of the game and was a key character of the whole story. She went insane after her love interest died in the end.   </p>
